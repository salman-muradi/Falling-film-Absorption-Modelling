# Falling-film-Absorption-Modelling
This project models the complex heat and mass transfer process in a falling film absorption system.
The falling film absorption technology is widely used in asborption chillers and heat pump systems because of its higher performance and simpler geometry compared to other types such as bubble absober, spray-type, and microchannel absorbers. However, the design of faling film absorber is usually complicated due to the complex nature of heat and mass transfer occuring in the component. In order to optimize the efficiency and performance of an absorption chiller/heat pump system and reduce the system size and cost as well as improve its markettability, understanding the nature of the heat and mass transfer process is crucial. Therefore, this project intends to model the effect of nanofluid on heat and mass process in an absorption chiller system and provide insights about further optimization of the system.
